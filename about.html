    <h1>WHO AM I?</h1>
    <p>I’m a woman in my early 30's who has always had a deep connection with nature and the outdoors. 
        <br/>Some of my earliest and happiest memories are of being outside, 
        <br/>soaking in the fresh air and freedom that only the natural world can offer. 
        <br/>While life took me in different directions for a while, the last six years have brought me back to where my heart belongs — 
        <br/>exploring the outdoors, especially hiking in the mountains and camping under the stars.
        <br/>
        <br/>My grandfather has called me “Jullan” for as long as I can remember, 
        <br/>and that nickname feels perfectly tied to my identity as an adventurer and lover of the outdoors. 
        <br/>These days, I spend as much time as I can exploring the incredible Nordic landscapes. 
        <br/>From the rugged mountain trails to the quiet beauty of a forest at dusk, 
        <br/>there’s nothing that compares to the serenity and inspiration I find in nature.
        <br/>
        <br/>Sleeping in the mountains has become one of my greatest joys. 
        <br/>It’s where I sleep the best, surrounded by the stillness of the wilderness and the comforting sounds of nature. 
        <br/>Whether it’s a short day hike to a stunning viewpoint or a multi-day exploration deep into remote terrain, 
        <br/>I thrive on the opportunity to disconnect from the everyday and connect with the beauty of the world around me.
        <br/>
        <br/>Over time, this passion has grown into something I love sharing with others. 
        <br/>Through my journeys, I capture the magic of Nordic nature with photography and videography. 
        <br/>From dramatic landscapes to tiny, vibrant details in the flora and fauna, 
        <br/>I want to show the world why these spaces matter—and why they deserve to be protected. 
        <br/>National parks and untouched wilderness areas are treasures we must preserve for future generations.
        <br/>
        <br/>Along with sharing beautiful imagery, I also enjoy offering practical tips and advice for those looking to embark on their own outdoor adventures. 
        <br/>Whether it’s tips on how to pack for an overnight hike, advice on staying safe in unpredictable weather, or sharing detailed hiking routes, 
        <br/>I love helping others feel confident about stepping into the wild.
        <br/>
        <br/>To me, the outdoors isn’t just a destination—it’s a way of life. 
        <br/>It’s about the calm that comes with a quiet sunrise on a mountaintop, the sense of accomplishment after a challenging hike, 
        <br/>and the deep connection to something greater than ourselves. I hope my stories, 
        <br/>photos, and videos inspire you to fall in love with nature too, 
        <br/>whether you’re exploring your local trails or dreaming of Nordic landscapes.
        <br/>
        <br/>Join me on this journey, as I share not only the beauty of the outdoors but also the importance of caring for it. 
        <br/>
        <br/>Let’s explore, learn, and preserve our natural world together!</p>

        <p>ᨒ Every summer I spend 5-9 nights in the Swedish or Norwegian mountains 
            <br/>to dissconnect from the stress in the everyday life.</p>
        
        <p>ᨒ I did gymnastics for 15 years growing up, and I can still stand in the bridge position.</p>
        
        <p>ᨒ My music taste is everyting from rock, punk, metal, poodle rock and everything in between. 
        <br/>This suprises a lot of people as I don't look like I listen to that genre.</p>
            
        <p>ᨒ My favorite candy is licorice (preferably as salt as possible).</p>
